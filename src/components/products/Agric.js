                    Green House farming in Nigeria is planting and growing crops
                    in an enclosed environment, Greenhouse Farming is the
                    process of cultivating crops and vegetable in a greenhouse
                    ecosystems environment. Cultivation in greenhouses is a
                    practice that has allowed farmers to increase their
                    performance, while improving the quality of products,
                    isolating them in micro-ecosystems that have the ideal
                    conditions for plants to grow healthy, strong and beautiful.

                    The production of palm oil in Nigeria reached 1.4 million
                    metric tons. Between 2009 and 2022, the production quantity
                    generally increased, registering the highest growth in 2010,
                    when it grew by roughly 14 percent. From 2014 onwards, the
                    output from palm oil production followed a rising trend.

                  <p>
                    The seed has numerous uses, one of which is it’s being a
                    very good source of vegetable oil that contains no
                    cholesterol, making it the most demanded vegetable oil in
                    the world. Nigeria has been one of the highest sesame seed
                    producing countries over the years, making the seed a very
                    important component of the country’s agricultural export.

                    Tropical areas are where the seeds are mainly cultivated.
                    Due to the drought-resistant nature of the sesame plant, it
                    thrives excellently in the Northern part of the country and
                    averagely in some parts of Southwest.

                    The cashew seed is often considered a nut in the culinary
                    sense; this cashew nut is eaten on its own, used in recipes,
                    or processed into cashew cheese or cashew butter. Like the
                    tree, the nut is often simply called cashew. Culinary uses
                    for cashew seeds in snacking and cooking are similar to
                    those for all tree seeds called nuts.

                    Cocoa beans are the seeds of cacao plants that are extracted
                    from its fruit called “pods”. When the seeds are removed
                    from pods, they are very moist. So, they need to be roasted
                    to make them dry for making cocoa powder. There are many
                    products that are made from cocoa beans and many of them
                    have various health benefits.

                    Honey is a sweet, golden liquid made by honeybees. Honeybees
                    store their honey in small, hexagonal cups called a
                    honeycomb. Natural honey comes straight from the honeycomb.
                    &nbsp;Natural honey is a sweet, flavorful liquid food of
                    high nutritional value. It’s very high in beneficial plant
                    compounds and offers several health benefits. Honey is
                    particularly healthy when used instead of refined sugar,
                    which is 100% empty calories.

                  <p>
                    Ginger is a tropical flowering plant that originally grew in
                    Southeast Asia but is now widely available from growers
                    around the world. The leafy plant grows to about three feet
                    tall and produces clusters of greenish-purple flowers. It’s
                    harvested by pulling the entire plant out of the soil,
                    removing the leaves and cleaning the root.

                    Ginger can be eaten fresh, dried, and stored as a spice, or
                    made into tablets, capsules, and liquid extracts. The demand
                    for ginger in the international market has grown remarkably
                    because the root is now being used as a raw material in the
                    manufacturing process and in the cosmetic industry as a
                    fragrance in soaps and beauty products.

                    Soybeans, (Glycine max), also called soja bean, is an annual
                    legume of the pea family and its edible seed. The soybean is
                    economically the most important bean in the world, providing
                    vegetable protein for millions of people and ingredients for
                    hundreds of chemical products. As soybeans mature in the
                    pot, they ripen into hard, dry beans. Although most soybeans
                    are yellow, there are also rare varieties that are black,
                    brown, or green colored.

                  <p>
                    Garlic is a plant in the Allium (onion) family. It is
                    closely related to onions, shallots, and leeks. Each segment
                    of a garlic bulb is called a clove. There are about 10–20
                    cloves in a single bulb. Garlic grows in many parts of the
                    world and is a popular ingredient in cooking due to its
                    strong smell and delicious taste. However, throughout
                    ancient history, the main use of garlic was for its health
                    and medicinal properties.

                    Cotton Lint
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a ball
                    around the seeds of cotton plants. &nbsp;It belongs to the
                    mallow family of plants. There are three primary products
                    derived from cotton production: cotton lint, linters, and
                    cottonseed. Cotton lint is used in making towels, clothing,
                    and shoestrings. The commercial varieties have been
                    developed over a long period, by selection and crossbreeding
                    of four distinct botanical species.

                    Gum Arabic
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gum Arabic is a soluble fiber obtained from Acacia Senegal
                    and Acacia Seyal trees grown in sub-Saharan Africa,
                    particularly Sudan. It is one of the most important
                    medicinal plants used in traditional, or alternative,
                    medicine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gum Arabic structure allows it to dissolve in cold or warm
                    water (meaning it’s water-soluble), making it easy to use in
                    a variety of ways. Because it is a natural, plant-derived
                    product, it’s suitable for vegans/vegetarians. It is also
                    naturally gluten-free, and well tolerated by most people
                    when used inappropriate/small amounts. It is used in the
                    food industry as a stabilizer, emulsifier, and thickening
                    agent.
